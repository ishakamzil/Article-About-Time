      <pre id="pre1">
        Time is more valuable and important than money, although most people car 
         more about money than time; Where the money cannot be used to buy more and more time, 
        but in return the time can be used to get a lot of money.[1]

        Every person in the universe has a day of only twenty-four hours, in which every minute
         counts and must be used; Because it can't come back after it's gone, the person who has 
         achieved a lot is the person who used a great deal of time with hard work; 
         To achieve and master the required skills.[1]
      </pre>

      <h4 id="part2" >Time management benefits</h4>
      <pre id="pre2" >
        There are a number of benefits that can be obtained if time is managed better, and they
         are as follows:[2] Achieving a lot of achievements in a shorter time and less effort, 
        by prioritizing tasks and trying to use the time to implement them.
       
        Feeling the beauty of work, and that life has a purpose; Because spending time without 
        production is one of the most annoying and frustrating things for the individual, the 
        feeling of accomplishment helps to continue working, and thus
         the ability to relax and enjoy time.
       
        Get rid of hesitation and confusion, when worrying about the decisions taken, whether they are 
        correct or not, this is a waste of time. Achieving goals quickly, when you do not appreciate and
         understand the importance of time management, these goals may remain on the side indefinitely.
       
       Enhance self-confidence, by taking care of yourself properly and allocating time for it.
       
       Getting a lot of energy, doing a lot of work, and building new skills; To improve work,
        when you feel that there is activity and an increase in energy, 
       
       you can try to go on a beautiful adventure, or try a hobby instead of staying on the sofa.
       
       Doing the things that a person loves, after setting the time needed to sleep, work, eat,
        and others, there are four hours a day to devote to pleasure.

      <h4 id="part3" >Ways to use time</h4>
      <pre id="pre3" >
        There are a number of things that can avoid wasting time, and make good use of it,
         which are as follows: [3]

        Turn off the phone as much as possible: it takes a lot of time, so it can be used more
         productively, and the phone must be turned off when doing other work, or it can be placed 
         in a place out of reach if it is necessary to operate it, in addition 
        to the possibility of turning off any notifications on The phone is not important to work.
       
        Close unnecessary browsers: Many people depend on the computer and the Internet to get 
        work done. Working while Facebook, Twitter, or others are on the browser in other tabs 
        may affect time management skills.
       
       Block and block certain social media: Sometimes the temptation to log into social
        media is unavoidable.
       
       Avoid frequent interruptions as much as possible: stopping mid-task to do 
       something else may make it difficult to return to previous work; 
       So when doing a task you should try to complete it before starting something.
